Architecture of sample multiple microservices developed in different technologies - Spring Boot, Node.js, Python, React.js in a project.
Microservices connected by an API Gateway using Netflix Zuul.


## Application Architecture

The application consists of 6 different Microservices

-   [shoes-microservice-spring-boot](https://github.com/sarat9/microservices-architect-config-starter/tree/main/shoes-microservice-spring-boot)  - Spring Boot App with Shoe data
-   [offers-microservice-spring-boot](https://github.com/sarat9/microservices-architect-config-starter/tree/main/offers-microservice-spring-boot)  - Spring Boot App with Offers data
-   [cart-microservice-nodejs](https://github.com/sarat9/microservices-architect-config-starter/tree/main/cart-microservice-nodejs)  - Node.js App with Cart data
-   [wishlist-microservice-python](https://github.com/sarat9/microservices-architect-config-starter/tree/main/wishlist-microservice-python)  - Python App with Wishlist data
-   [zuul-api-gateway](https://github.com/sarat9/microservices-architect-config-starter/tree/main/zuul-api-gateway)  - API gateway that proxies all the micro-services
-   [ui-web-app-reactjs](https://github.com/sarat9/microservices-architect-config-starter/tree/main/ui-web-app-reactjs)  - Single Page Application that provides the UI

# Microservices
Microservices are Decentralized, Independent and  Loosely coupled.
Before we go into why we need microservices. Lets understand the problems of our traditional monolitic approach.

## Problems of Monolithic
Problems of Monolithic:

- Large monolithic code base makes complicated to understand and maintain as it grows.
- Scaling become challenging - As everything is packaged in one EAR/WAR, Scaling such a monolithic application can only be accomplished by deploying the same EAR/WAR packages in more servers â€” also known as horizontal scaling. Each copy of the application in various servers will utilize the same amount of underlying resources, which is often not an efficient way to design.
- Tightly coupled
- Extremely difficult to change technology or language or framework (hybrid technologies) because everything is tightly coupled and depend up on each other.
- Non ability to change tech stack will affect business badly and make it lose lot of modern tech solutions.
- Refactoring code base is difficult
- No fault isolation - If any single function fails, the entire application goes down.
- If a particular function consumes more memory, entire application feels the pain.


## Why go for Microservices?
- A microservices architecture takes single responsibility principle approach.
- Microservices are small, independent, and loosely coupled.
- Microservices are Decentralized, Highly maintainable, Independently deployable. 
- Do one thing well. Organized around business capabilities.
- Agility, scalability, availability, reusability. 
- Improves fault isolation.
- Eliminates long-term commitment to a single technology stack, Code for different services can be written in different languages
- Can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently.
- Services can also be deployed independently of each other and hence its easy to identify hot services and scale them independent of whole application. 
- Development Team Scaling - Each service is a separate codebase, which can be managed by a small development team.
- Development Speed: Microservices are often quite small in size. Due to the size, adding new features in Microservices are usually faster.
